# Refactoring Summary: Improved Polymarket API

## What Changed

### Before (Problem)
- `download_polymarket_prices_by_event()` used `candidate_name` parameter
- This was too specific to presidential elections
- Didn't generalize to other types of events

### After (Solution)
Split into two separate functions:

1. **`get_event_markets(event_slug)`** - Explore markets in an event
2. **`download_polymarket_prices_by_event(event_slug, market_id, ...)`** - Download data

## New Workflow (Recommended)

```python
from polymarket_data import get_event_markets, download_polymarket_prices_by_event
from datetime import datetime

# Step 1: Explore what markets are available
markets = get_event_markets("presidential-election-winner-2024")

for market_id, info in markets.items():
    print(f"{market_id}: {info['question']}")
    print(f"  Token IDs: {info['token_ids']}")
    print(f"  Volume: ${info['volume']}")

# Step 2: Download data for a specific market
df = download_polymarket_prices_by_event(
    event_slug="presidential-election-winner-2024",
    market_id="Donald Trump",  # Use market_id from step 1
    outcome_index=0,  # 0 = "Yes", 1 = "No"
    start_date=datetime(2024, 10, 28),
    end_date=datetime(2024, 11, 5),
    fidelity=60
)
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Better Separation of Concerns
- **Discovery**: `get_event_markets()` returns all available markets with metadata
- **Download**: `download_polymarket_prices_by_event()` downloads data for a specific market

### 2. More General
- Works for ANY event type, not just elections
- Market identifier comes from the data itself (groupItemTitle or question)
- No hardcoded assumptions about "candidates"

### 3. More Informative
`get_event_markets()` returns rich metadata:
```python
{
    "market_id": {
        "question": "Full question text",
        "token_ids": ["yes_token", "no_token"],
        "slug": "market-slug",
        "description": "Market description",
        "outcomes": ["Yes", "No"],
        "volume": 1234567.89,
        "closed": false,
        "end_date": "2024-11-05T12:00:00Z"
    }
}
```

## Migration Guide

### Old Code
```python
# This still works but parameters changed
df = download_polymarket_prices_by_event(
    event_slug="presidential-election-winner-2024",
    candidate_name="Donald Trump",  # OLD PARAMETER
    ...
)
```

### New Code
```python
# Step 1: Get markets first
markets = get_event_markets("presidential-election-winner-2024")

# Step 2: Use market_id instead of candidate_name
df = download_polymarket_prices_by_event(
    event_slug="presidential-election-winner-2024",
    market_id="Donald Trump",  # NEW PARAMETER
    ...
)
```

## All Available Functions

1. **`get_event_info(event_slug)`** - Get raw event data from API
2. **`get_event_markets(event_slug)`** - Get processed market data (RECOMMENDED)
3. **`slug_to_token_ids(slug, is_event)`** - Get token IDs for event/market
4. **`download_polymarket_prices(token_id, ...)`** - Download by token ID (fastest)
5. **`download_polymarket_prices_by_event(event_slug, market_id, ...)`** - Download by event+market (easy)
6. **`download_polymarket_prices_by_slug(market_slug, ...)`** - Download by market slug (slow, not recommended)

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Explore an Event
```python
markets = get_event_markets("presidential-election-winner-2024")
for market_id in markets.keys():
    print(market_id)
```

### Use Case 2: Download Multiple Markets
```python
markets = get_event_markets("presidential-election-winner-2024")

for market_id in ["Donald Trump", "Kamala Harris"]:
    df = download_polymarket_prices_by_event(
        event_slug="presidential-election-winner-2024",
        market_id=market_id,
        start_date=datetime(2024, 10, 28),
        end_date=datetime(2024, 11, 5),
        fidelity=60
    )
    print(f"{market_id}: {len(df)} data points")
```

### Use Case 3: Get Token IDs for Custom Analysis
```python
markets = get_event_markets("presidential-election-winner-2024")
trump_token_yes = markets["Donald Trump"]["token_ids"][0]
trump_token_no = markets["Donald Trump"]["token_ids"][1]

# Use token IDs directly with download_polymarket_prices()
df = download_polymarket_prices(
    token_id=trump_token_yes,
    start_date=datetime(2024, 10, 28),
    end_date=datetime(2024, 11, 5),
    fidelity=60
)
```

## Files Updated

1. **`polymarket_data.py`**
   - Added `get_event_markets()` at line 353
   - Refactored `download_polymarket_prices_by_event()` at line 415
   - Changed parameter from `candidate_name` to `market_id`

2. **`tests/test_polymarket_download.py`**
   - Added `test_get_event_markets()` test
   - Updated `test_download_by_event()` to use new signature

3. **`QUICK_START_POLYMARKET.md`**
   - Updated with new two-step workflow

4. **`example_improved_workflow.py`**
   - New comprehensive example demonstrating best practices

5. **`REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
   - Documents the changes and migration path

## Why This Is Better

✅ **Generalizes to any event type** (not just elections)
✅ **Separates discovery from download** (cleaner API)
✅ **Provides rich metadata** (volume, outcomes, descriptions)
✅ **No hardcoded assumptions** (works with any market structure)
✅ **More Pythonic** (explicit is better than implicit)
