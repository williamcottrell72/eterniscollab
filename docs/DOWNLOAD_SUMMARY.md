# Market History Download Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the market history download system created for analyzing Polymarket data.

## What Was Built

### 1. Market Selection System

Two sets of 30 markets selected for analysis:

**By Total Volume (`selected_markets.json`)**
- 10 high volume markets (>$76M)
- 10 medium volume markets (~$11k)
- 10 low volume markets (<$1)

**By Weekly Volume (`selected_markets_volume1wk.json`)**
- 10 high weekly volume markets (>$19M)
- 10 medium weekly volume markets (~$11k)
- 10 low weekly volume markets (<$1)

### 2. Download Infrastructure

**Core Module: `market_history_downloader.py`**
- `download_market_complete_history()`: Download all outcomes for a single market
- `download_market_list()`: Batch download multiple markets
- `load_market_data()`: Load downloaded data from disk
- `RateLimiter`: Prevent server overload with exponential backoff

**Features:**
- ✅ Downloads complete price histories from market start to close
- ✅ Handles all outcomes (Yes/No for binary markets)
- ✅ Automatic chunking for long date ranges (>14 days)
- ✅ Rate limiting (0.5s min delay, exponential backoff on errors)
- ✅ Retry logic (3 attempts per outcome)
- ✅ Efficient caching (Parquet format)
- ✅ Organized directory structure
- ✅ Comprehensive metadata storage

### 3. Data Organization

```
data/polymarket/market_histories/
├── market-slug-1/
│   ├── metadata.json          # Full market information
│   ├── summary.json            # Download summary stats
│   ├── outcome_0.parquet       # Price history for outcome 0
│   └── outcome_1.parquet       # Price history for outcome 1
├── market-slug-2/
│   └── ...
└── download_summary.json       # Overall batch summary
```

### 4. Download Scripts

**`download_selected_markets.py`**
- Downloads 30 markets selected by total volume
- Fidelity: 10-minute bars
- Uses caching to avoid re-downloads

**`download_selected_markets_volume1wk.py`**
- Downloads 30 markets selected by weekly volume
- Duplicate slugs automatically use cache (no wasted compute)
- Same fidelity and caching strategy

**`market_history_example.py`**
- Complete examples of loading and analyzing data
- Demonstrates common patterns and workflows
- Shows how to export data for external analysis

### 5. Documentation

- Complete API reference
- Usage examples for all functions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Performance benchmarks

**`POLYMARKET_DATA_README.md`** (existing)
- Core API documentation
- Price data download functions
- Market discovery tools

**`CLOSED_MARKETS_README.md`** (existing)
- How to fetch metadata for all closed markets
- Filtering and selection examples

## Current Status

### Downloads in Progress

**Total Volume Markets (download_selected_markets.py)**
- Status: In progress (market 18/30 as of latest check)
- Log file: `data/polymarket/download_log_fixed.txt`
- Estimated completion: ~15-20 more minutes

**Weekly Volume Markets (download_selected_markets_volume1wk.py)**
- Status: Ready to run
- Many markets will use cache from first batch
- Expected to run faster due to cache hits

### Bug Fixes Applied

**Issue:** DateTime comparison error
**Fix:** Changed filtering to use Unix timestamps instead of datetime objects
**Location:** `polymarket_data.py` line 333-336

## How to Use

### Quick Start

```bash
# Check download progress
tail -f data/polymarket/download_log_fixed.txt

# Download weekly volume markets (after first batch completes)
python download_selected_markets_volume1wk.py > data/polymarket/download_log_volume1wk.txt 2>&1 &

# Run examples
python market_history_example.py
```

### Load Data in Python

```python
from market_history_downloader import load_market_data

# Load a market
data = load_market_data("will-donald-trump-be-inaugurated")

# Access data
print(data['metadata']['question'])
yes_df = data['outcomes'][0]  # Price history DataFrame
no_df = data['outcomes'][1]

# Analyze
print(f"Yes outcome: {len(yes_df)} data points")
print(f"Price range: {yes_df['price'].min():.3f} - {yes_df['price'].max():.3f}")
```

### Explore Downloaded Markets

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

# List all downloaded markets
market_dir = Path("data/polymarket/market_histories")
markets = [d.name for d in market_dir.iterdir() if d.is_dir()]

print(f"Downloaded {len(markets)} markets:")
for slug in sorted(markets):
    metadata_file = market_dir / slug / "metadata.json"
    if metadata_file.exists():
        import json
        with open(metadata_file) as f:
            meta = json.load(f)
        print(f"  {slug}: {meta['question'][:60]}...")
```

## Data Statistics

### Expected Dataset Size

**30 markets (total volume)**:
- Binary markets: ~60 outcomes total
- Average duration: ~50-100 days
- Fidelity: 10 minutes
- Estimated total data points: ~500k-1M
- Estimated storage: ~50-100 MB

**30 markets (weekly volume)**:
- Additional ~30-60 outcomes (some overlap with first batch)
- Cache hits will save significant time
- Estimated additional storage: ~20-40 MB

### Performance Metrics

- Download speed: ~2,000 data points per 14-day chunk
- API request time: ~0.5-1 second (with rate limiting)
- Cache load time: <0.1 seconds
- Typical market (79 days, 2 outcomes): ~22,900 data points, ~5-10 seconds

## Next Steps for Analysis

### Suggested Workflows

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Load all markets
   - Calculate summary statistics

   - Compare outcomes across markets

2. **Time Series Modeling**
   - Build prediction models using price history
   - Test different forecasting approaches
   - Evaluate model performance on closed markets

3. **Market Efficiency Analysis**
   - Compare final prices to actual outcomes
   - Measure calibration and accuracy
   - Identify systematic biases

4. **Volume-Based Analysis**

## Troubleshooting

### Check Download Status

```bash

tail -f data/polymarket/download_log_fixed.txt

# Count completed markets
grep "✓ COMPLETE:" data/polymarket/download_log_fixed.txt | wc -l

# Check for errors
grep "✗ FAILED" data/polymarket/download_log_fixed.txt
```

### Verify Data Quality

```python
from market_history_downloader import load_market_data
import pandas as pd

slug = "will-donald-trump-be-inaugurated"
data = load_market_data(slug)

# Check data completeness
for name, df in zip(data['outcome_names'], data['outcomes']):
    print(f"{name}:")
    print(f"  Points: {len(df)}")
    print(f"  Missing: {df.isna().sum().sum()}")
    print(f"  Date range: {df['timestamp'].min()} to {df['timestamp'].max()}")
```

### Common Issues

**"Market data not found"**
- Wait for downloads to complete
- Check slug spelling
- Verify market was in selection

**"Download too slow"**
- This is normal for markets with long date ranges
- Automatic chunking adds overhead but is necessary
- Each 14-day chunk takes ~1-2 seconds

**"Cache not working"**
- Check `overwrite=False` in download calls
- Verify Parquet files exist in market directories
- Check file permissions

## Contact & Support
